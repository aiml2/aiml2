**A**pplied stat**I**stics, **M**achine **L**earning **L**euven

Start of a github community focused on Applied statIstics, Machine Learning in Leuven. I chose GitHub for this because it has everything available for ease of collaboration, sharing, teaching, hobbying, making, brainstorming and because it's an open platform.

Why the focus on Leuven? Because I like working locally and I live in Leuven and plan to for a long time. I will not restrict outside contributions (that wouldn't be in the open spirit of GitHub) but I'd like the center of the community to be in Leuven from the start.

If you have suggestions feel free to do a Pull Request (PR) or open an Issue in the issue tab.


## Planned projects:

- Basic github page website
- Educational resources repository
- Getting started guide, Git(Hub) 101, ...
- Community guidelines (?)
- Project Becona (ML Image classification project I did and want to share)
- (Your ideas here ..., press edit!)
