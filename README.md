Start of a github community focused on Applied statIstics, Machine Learning in Leuven. I chose GitHub for this because it has everything available for ease of collaboration, sharing, teaching, hobbying, making, brainstorming and because it's an open platform.

Why the focus on Leuven? Because I like working locally and I live in Leuven and plan to for a long time. I will not restrict outside contributions (that wouldn't be in the open spirit of GitHub) but I'd like the center of the community to be in Leuven from the start.
